## Whether or not reinforcement value should accumulate indefinitely, as opposed to reaching the limits specified by the Reinforceable Blocks List.

#======== Reinforcement Item List ========#

## A list of all the items which can be used to reinforce blocks, and their corresponding reinforcement values.
# Notes:
#   Setting a value of -2 will mean the reinforcement will automatically be the maximum value the block can take.
#   Any other value less than 1 is invalid.
#   If "accumulateReinforcementValues" is set to true, any material set here with a reinforcement value of -2 will not reinforce blocks.
